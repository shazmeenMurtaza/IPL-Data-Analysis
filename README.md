# IPL Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes IPL (Indian Premier League) match data to extract insights about
team performance, match outcomes, and player statistics using Python.

The focus of this project is exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on a real-world sports dataset.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- File: `IPL.csv`
- Format: CSV
- Contains match-level information including teams, players, venues, results, and margins

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas (data cleaning, filtering, aggregation)
- NumPy (numerical operations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)

---

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed
- Loaded and explored the IPL dataset
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Analyzed team performance and match outcomes
- Identified top run scorers and best bowling performances
- Visualized trends and comparisons using graphs

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain teams showed consistently strong performance across multiple matches
- A small group of players dominated batting and bowling statistics
- Some matches were decided by large winning margins, indicating one-sided games

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened practical skills in Pandas and NumPy
- Gained experience working with real-world, messy data
- Improved ability to extract and communicate insights through visualization
- Developed better understanding of exploratory data analysis workflow

---

## ▶ How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`)
2. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations

## 🔗 Project Status
This project is part of my learning journey in data analytics.
Future improvements include deeper NumPy-based analysis, SQL integration,
and more advanced statistical insights.
